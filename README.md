# ðŸš€ EduConnect: Smart Academic Administration of School Database

# About the project

EduConnect is a comprehensive educational platform designed to foster seamless communication and 
collaboration among administrators, teachers, and students. This project utilizes SQL for structured data 
management and MongoDB for flexible chat functionalities, creating an integrated ecosystem to enhance 
the educational experience. EduConnect provides user authentication mechanisms, allowing secure access 
for administrators, teachers, and students. Dynamic user profiles enable individuals to manage personal 
information, educational backgrounds, and profile pictures. The platform offers academic management 
tools, allowing teachers to create, manage, and grade question papers, while students can access their test 
results, percentages, and grades.
Communication tools, powered by MongoDB, facilitate real-time interactions between students and 
counsellors. Video conferencing capabilities enable teachers to initiate virtual classrooms, enhancing 
direct interaction and doubt resolution. Administration tools empower administrators to manage users, 
post notices, and link teachers with students for effective organizational control.
